BSOC code classes:

DiffractionSample class works

No need for independent instrument and goniometer classes - need to add to precursor and README that this is only for reflexion


BSOC code will need the following Matplotlib functions:

# Plot irradiated length against 2theta
# Plot divergence slit against 2theta
# Superimpose irradiated footprint on sample x-y
# Superimpose irradiated depth on sample y-z
